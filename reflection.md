- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
The "MagicalAdventurer" class represents a magical adventurer who implements the "Contract" interface. This class defines the behavior and characteristics of a magical adventurer, including their abilities, actions, and properties. The class includes methods to perform various actions such as grabbing an item, dropping an item, examining an item, using an item to cast a spell, walking in a direction, flying to a specific location, shrinking in size, growing in size, getting and setting power level, and resting to regain power. The class also overrides methods from the "Contract" interface to provide implementations for certain actions. Overall, the "MagicalAdventurer" class represents a character with magical abilities that can perform various actions in a fantasy-themed adventure game.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I implemented the getPower and setPower methods. 

The "getPower" method is a getter method that allows the user to retrieve the current power level of the magical adventurer. It returns an integer value representing the power level of the adventurer. 

The "setPower" method is a setter method that allows the user to update the power level of the magical adventurer with a new value. It takes an integer value as an argument, which represents the new power level, and updates the power state of the adventurer accordingly. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I really liked how opened ended this assignment was. I enjoyed the creative freedom I had in this assignment to create any world I wanted and make a fun game out of it. I would advise future students to be creative and have fun!
